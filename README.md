# Pizzeria App (CRUD) - Server

This is a CRUD application built with React.js and Node.js. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of pizzas. The system consists of a frontend developed with React.js for the user interface and a backend implemented with Node.js for handling data storage and retrieval. The API has been implemented with GraphQL
